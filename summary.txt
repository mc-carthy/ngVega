Set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT variable to Development/Production as required in ~/.bash_profile

Add dotnet watch command in NgVega.csproj

Create the domain models for "Make" and "Model" and relate them using the MakeId foreign key

In VSCode, when we don't have NuGet package console, we add packages using the following syntax:
$ dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer

We create a DbContext and configure it for use with dependancy injection

Install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design

Make sure to add domain models to DbContext file in order to create migrations

We can use  $ dotnet ef database update MIGRATION_NAME to downgrade the database.
We can use 0 in place of the MIGRATION_NAME to revert the database to its original empty domain state

When creating domain resources, ensure there are no loops existing between resources

Add AutoMapper & AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection --version 1.2.0
